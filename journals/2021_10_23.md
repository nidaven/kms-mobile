episode-title:: You 2.0 Regrets
name:: [[Hidden Brain]]
theme:: emotion/regret, emotion/guilt
	- Regret and Guilt are two emotions that may seem hard to distinguish, making them easily conflated. While most times, it is one or the other that we feel, It is quite possible for an incident or memory to make us feel both *guilt* and *regret*.
	- Regret is a comparison between something that happened and another more desirable possible occurrence, or lack thereof.
	- Guilt on the other hand is a comparison between something we did or were involved in and a **personal** set standard for ourselves.
